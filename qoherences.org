Want to understand what the fate of quantum computers is with respect to error correction? Watch this! For controlling Satrun V, the computation was run in parallel on 2 computers ; for quantum computation you need to run it in a parallel encoded version (a logical qubit made of many physical ones) to achieve the same.

/Europe/ -- Europe is launching OPENQKD and initiative to test quantum communications in several european countries: Hungary, Portugal, Poland, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, and Spain. The important part is not QKD but quantum communication. QKD will be a test not the single final outcome of the initiative. Just saying this to all other Member states where people see QKD as the only thing to do with quantum networks. Well have a look at the quantum protocol zoo http://wiki.veriqloud.fr. By the way, where is France in this list ?

** Breaking News
Google will be claiming quantum supremacy. It's a huge step for the field. A working intermediate scale QC at Google was able to perform a computation much faster than any available classical super-computer. Beware: I didn't say *any* computation, but *a* computation. I let you reflect on this. For more there is the excellent [[https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317][Scott’s Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ!]], and even more in Preskill's article in [[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/][Quanta Magazine]]

/Scientific American - Los Alamos National Lab/ -- Decoherence is bad for quantum computing, but fortunately there are ways to fight it. Fault-tolerant gates are one of them. Optimized quantum circuits obtained via ML compilers are another. Here LANL researchers report using quantum computers to compile their own programs. Hey, we are getting away from low level assembly like code and circuits. Love it.

/Quanta magazine - Caltech - MIT/ -- Using computers to verify that a solution given to a problem is exact is a common cryptographic setting. Think of digital signatures, its easy to check but without the private key you can't encode, i.e find the solution to the problem. When using quantum computers, you can verify efficiently the solutions to some of the hardest imaginable problems. Yay quantum!
