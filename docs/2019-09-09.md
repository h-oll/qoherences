## [Quantum Darwinism spotted in diamond spins](https://physicsworld.com/a/quantum-darwinism-spotted-in-diamond-spins/)

*U. Ulm* &#x2013; People testing ideas I developped with Wojciech Zurek at LANL about 20 yrs ago. Feeling honored that people are spending time checking in real life what you have written on a piece of paper. Some more in a podcast from physics world <https://physicsworld.com/a/survival-of-the-fittest-quantum-states-scrutinizing-antihydrogen-physics-of-chilled-drinks/>

## [Why Quantum Computers Won’t Replace Classical Computers Anytime Soon](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2019/09/04/why-quantum-computers-wont-replace-classical-computers-anytime-soon/#7c432f68136a)

*Forbes* &#x2013; Always good to be aware of hype in an area. Interesting bit (at the end) partnership of SAP and Quantum Internet Alliance for undertanding what the future of computing will be, and also the need for the new generations of developpers to know some more algorithmics and linear algebra.
