/U. Ulm/ -- People testing ideas I developped with Wojciech Zurek at LANL about 20 yrs ago. Feeling honored that people are spending time checking in real life what you have written on a piece of paper. Some more in a podcast from physics world https://physicsworld.com/a/survival-of-the-fittest-quantum-states-scrutinizing-antihydrogen-physics-of-chilled-drinks/

/Forbes/ -- Always good to be aware of hype in an area. Interesting bit (at the end) partnership of SAP and Quantum Internet Alliance for undertanding what the future of computing will be, and also the need for the new generations of developpers to know some more algorithmics and linear algebra.

* Positions
** 2 year Postdoc at Griffith U.
/Griffith U./ -- The Centre for Quantum Dynamics at Griffith University is offering a 2-year Postdoctoral Research Fellow position in quantum foundations. The Research Fellow will be funded by, and expected to contribute to, two externally-funded research projects led by Dr Eric Cavalcanti: Australian Research Council Future Fellowship “Fine-tuning the quantum: foundations and applications of quantum causality” and Foundational Questions Institute Large Grant “Causal reasoning in quantum agents”.  The successful applicant will have a PhD in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Philosophy, or related fields, and may contribute to these projects through conceptual, analytical or numerical work, depending on the applicant’s background and interests. The position is also required to undertake higher degree research supervision.
