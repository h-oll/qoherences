Want to understand what the fate of quantum computers is with respect to error correction? Watch this! For controlling Satrun V, the computation was run in parallel on 2 computers ; for quantum computation you need to run it in a parallel encoded version (a logical qubit made of many physical ones) to achieve the same.
