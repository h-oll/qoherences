[[https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2020/][Eurocrypt]] is one major conference in cryptography and secure computing. This year it will go virtual may 11-15. As usual it will have a few (good) talks on quantum. I've already seen "Secure Multi-party Quantum Computation with a Dishonest Majority" it's a nice one!

The final program hasn't been released yet. The page will be updated then.
