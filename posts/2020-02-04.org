Lets start with a call from last year published in Nature that I find particularly important: [[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02675-5][Keep quantum computing global and open]]! 

* General Public Articles
** Computer Scientists Expand the Frontier of Verifiable Knowledge -- [[https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-expand-the-frontier-of-verifiable-knowledge-20190523/][source]]
/Quanta Magazine -- MIT, Caltech/ -- Very nice account on a work that emphasizes the questions raised by tapping into resources (quantum computers) to give you answers to problems that you don't know the answer of. 
** New algorithms to determine eigenstates and thermal states on quantum computers -- [[https://phys.org/news/2019-11-algorithms-eigenstates-thermal-states-quantum.html][source]]
/Nature -- CalTech/ -- New algorithms (quantum imaginary time)  useful to estimate properties of ground states and thermal states of quantum materials.
** Photonic quantum information processing: A concise review -- [[https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5115814][source]]
/AIP/ -- Review of the photonic path towards scalable fault tolerant QC.

/Phys.org -- U Chicago/ -- Not quite everyday's electronic, but quantum dots in silicon carbide. Interesting advances anyways.

* Industry - Academia - Startups
** Russia joins the quantum race -- [[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03855-z][source]]
/Nature -- Russia/ -- Russia plans to spend several hundred millions of dollars to boost its quantum information science and technology capabilities. There remains to see which institutes and labs will be receiving the money as the academic and start-up ecosystem is not much developed yet.
** Israel Gets Ready to Join Global Quantum Computing Race -- [[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-israel-gets-ready-to-join-global-quantum-computing-race-1.8202806][source]]
/Haaretz -- Israel/ -- 350m$ over 6 years in funding. Quite a lot. A small country with plenty of excellent quantum teams to spend the money on. 
** Nine More EU States Commit To Building A Quantum Communication Infrastructure -- [[https://www.cbronline.com/news/quantum-communication-infrastructure][source]]
/CBR/ -- Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, France, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Finland are the newest members entering into agreement that will see them work with ten EU states to establish a quantum communication infrastructure across Europe.
