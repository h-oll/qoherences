/QuTech, TU Delft, TNO/ -- Showing entanglement between all possible qubit pairs, ability to generate 7 qubits entanglement, and 1min decoherence time. That's super-long. Looking forward to see larger registers, and also how these can be used to serve as quantum repeaters in networks.
Some additional info at [[https://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.031045][physics.aps.org]].

Don't talk to me if you haven't read this. It you have but mix-up entanglement and correlations well, you'll be roasted :-)

/Europe/ -- Europe is launching OPENQKD and initiative to test quantum communications in several european countries: Hungary, Portugal, Poland, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, and Spain. The important part is not QKD but quantum communication. QKD will be a test not the single final outcome of the initiative. Just saying this to all other Member states where people see QKD as the only thing to do with quantum networks. Well have a look at the quantum protocol zoo http://wiki.veriqloud.fr. By the way, where is France in this list ?
